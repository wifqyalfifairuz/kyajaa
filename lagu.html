                [If there's another universe
                Please make some noise (noise)
                Give me a sign (sign)
                This can't be life
                If there's a point to losing love
                Repeating pain (why?)
                It's all the same
                I hate this place
                Stuck in this paradigm
                Don't believe in paradise
                This must be what Hell is like
                There's got to be more, got to be more
                Sick of this head of mine
                Intrusive thoughts, they paralyze
                Nirvana's not as advertised
                There's got to be more, been here before
                Ooh (ooh, ooh)
                Life's better on Saturn
                Got to break this pattern
                Of floating away
                Ooh (ooh, ooh)
                Find something worth saving
                It's all for the taking
                I always say
                I'll be better on Saturn
                None of this matters
                Dreaming of Saturn, oh
                If karma's really real
                How am I still here?
                Just seems so unfair
                I could be wrong though
                If there's a point to being good
                Then where's my reward?
                The good die young and poor
                I gave it all I could
                Stuck in this terradome
                All I see is terrible
                Making us hysterical
                There's got to be more, got to be more
                Sick of this head of mine
                Intrusive thoughts, they paralyze
                Nirvana's not as advertised
                There's got to be more, been here before
                Ooh (ooh, ooh)
                Life's better on Saturn
                Got to break this pattern

                Ooh (ooh, ooh)

                [When you do your best you ca-, I done told you
                When you do your best, hell, that's all you can do
                You, me and anybody else
                So they always start talkin'
                Ooh
                Runnin' away from where I'm from
                Never can stay with no one
                Loving you almost feels like something
                When no ones around me, you lost and found me
                I was surrounded
                With open, open, open, open arms (ooh)
                Open arms, you keep me open
                I'm so devoted
                You keep me open, open arms
                I'm so devoted to you, to you, to you
                Spent your life bein' hopeless
                Chokin' on insecurity
                I know all this is bad
                But, please, put a leash on me anyway
                Who needs self-esteem anyway?
                I hate myself to make you stay
                Push me away, I'll be right here
                With open, open, open, open arms (ooh)
                Open arms, you keep me open
                I'm so devoted
                You keep me open, open arms
                I'm so devoted to you, to you, to you
                No matter what come between us, yeah, I decided (ayy)
                I'm forever ridin' (whoa), you're forever guidin' (ayy)
                Pull up on an opp, hit his curb up, slide it (brr)
                Notice when you mad, ain't no words, just silence (ooh)
                You my favorite color, now you seein' every shade of me
                You say that I'm trippin', I hit back like, "Where you takin' me?"
                Locked in for life, on God, no replacin' me
                Consequences, repercussions, karma keep on changin' me
                For you I try, face card valid, ID
                C'est la vie, go to Paris, it ain't five-star, it ain't me
                Over-solid, keep it concrete, I'ma bet it on your whole fee
                Just don't switch sides, I could fire piece your wrist, AP
                Through the ups and downs and all the heat
                Take a turn and tell you what it be
                Backshots make you feel relief, anything, just don't you ever leave
                I guess I gotta go
                I guess it's time to go
                I gotta let you go
                (I'm so devoted)
                You keep me open
                Gotta let you go, gotta let you go
                I gotta let you go, I must
                You're the only one that's holdin' me down
                (You're the only one holdin' me down)
                ('Cause I'm the only one that's holdin' me down)]<br>
